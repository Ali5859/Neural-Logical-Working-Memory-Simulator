This application is a "Neural-Logical Working Memory Simulator," a cognitive game that models how human memory functions under pressure. From a neuroscience perspective, it simulates the process of loading information into working memory (memorizing words), creatively synthesizing that information (story writing), and shifting to a more structured, logical processing state when cognitively fatigued (solving logic puzzles). This provides an interactive experience of concepts like memory capacity, creative flow, cognitive load, and mental recovery. The creator developed this using a free API and would be grateful for any Bitcoin (BTC) donations to support the project's continuation. BTC network: bc1q933gvm4ttgu3m3sj5pn0c0lhu2h89ns6atdpzs BTW the next project on hand-eye coordination will be open-sourced
